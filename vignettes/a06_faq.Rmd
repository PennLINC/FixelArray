## Prepare your data for ModelArray
### What kind of fixel data should I use?
Before using ModelArray, you should be at the stage where you have got fixel data from MRtrix by following the fixel-based analysis. If we use paper [Dhollander et al., 2021](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2021.118417) Fig.3. The fixel-based analysis pipeline as an example, we expect you have done the step "Connectivity-based fixel smoothing". You will use the subject-level fixel data in template space from this step for further fixel-wise statistical analysis in ModelArray. We expect the file format is mif.

### How should I organize the data?
The example data organization shown in the demo data (see `vignette("a02_walkthrough")`) is what we recommend. In that example fixel dataset, the metric is `FDC`. If you have also other metrics such as FC, you may also have folder `FC` and CSV file `cohort_FC_n100.csv` in the `myProject` folder.

### What are the requirements of the CSV file?
We expect this CSV file at least contains these two columns - see example in `vignette("a02_walkthrough")`, the required columns are highlighted in ***bold and italics***:

-   `scalar_name`: how should we call your metric?
-   `source_file`: the filename of the subject-level fixel data. In the next step of data conversion with ConFixel, we will use `~/Desktop/myProject` as the main folder (`relative_root`), so here, we only need to provide the path starting from folder `FDC`.

Other columns are optional - simply add covariates you'll use in the statistical analysis in ModelArray. The order of columns can be changed.
